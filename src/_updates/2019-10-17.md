## What's new in both Ubuntu 16.04 and Ubuntu 18.04 images

* [#3134](https://github.com/appveyor/ci/issues/3134) Fixed: NuGet source registration is missing on Ubuntu images
* [#3148](https://github.com/appveyor/ci/issues/3148) Hide "dotnet" CLI "welcome" message

## Previous worker images

There are build worker images available from previous deployment. You can use them in case of any issues with the current images:

* `Previous Ubuntu`
* `Previous Ubuntu1604`
* `Previous Ubuntu1804`

You can select build worker image in "Build worker image" dropdown on Environment tab of project settings or if you use `appveyor.yml`:

```yaml
image: Previous Ubuntu
```
